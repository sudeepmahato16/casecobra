## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

#### Prerequisites

- Git:
  If you want to clone the project from GitHub and work with it locally, you will need to have Git installed on your system. You can download and install Git from the official website (**[https://git-scm.com/](https://git-scm.com/)**).
- Node.js:
  Application requires Node.js to be installed on your system in order to run. You can download and install the latest version of Node.js from the official website (**[https://nodejs.org/](https://nodejs.org/)**).
- npm (Node Package Manager):
  npm is the package manager for Node.js, and is used to manage the dependencies and packages required for your Next.js project. It is installed automatically when you install Node.js.
  To check if npm is installed on your system, you can open a terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:

  ```bash
  npm -v
  ```

- pnpm: pnpm is a fast, space-saving JavaScript package manager that links shared dependencies, speeding up installs and saving disk space.
  ```bash
  npm install -g pnpm
  ```

Once you have these prerequisites in place, you can proceed to clone the project from GitHub using Git.
